# Abstract

This study investigates the association between academic workload and student mental health, specifically examining stress levels, sleep quality, and work-life balance among STA304H5 students at our university. The aim is to analyze how these factors correlate with various mental health indicators. Data collection will be based on the structured questionnaire method, while data analyses will be based on chi-square tests of independence, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance to identify which of those relationships and trends are statistically significant.

# Introduction

The academic workload faced by university students has increasingly become one of the critical variables for university students concerning mental health. Given a broader context of increasing academic demons, many students experience heightened stress levels, which impact various aspects of their well-being, including sleep quality, work-life balance, and several mental health issues.

First, commonly reported mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and stress, have been found to correlate with academic pressures in highly competitive or rigorous programs where students may feel unable to meet academic and personal expectations (Beiter et al., 2015). Second, research indicates that students experiencing high academic workload tend to report poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, which, in turn, can exacerbate mental health problems and academic performance challenges (Hershner & Chervin, 2014; Galambos et al., 2009). Third, students’ living environments and their ability to maintain a balanced lifestyle can also significantly impact mental health, since living in a more supportive and conducive environment positions students to better manage academic responsibilities and personal well-being (Kim & Koh, 2018).

Given the above potential factors, we seek to address the following research questions in this report:
Is there an association between students’ academic workload and amount of mental health issues?
Null Hypothesis: There is no association between academic workload and the amount of mental health issues
Alternative Hypothesis: There’s a significant association between academic workload and the amount of mental health issues.
How does the academic workload affect the quality/length of sleep and its subsequent impact on students' mental health?
Null Hypothesis: Academic workload does not affect the quality or length of sleep, nor does it affect students' mental health.
Alternative Hypothesis: Academic workload significantly affects the quality and/or amount of sleep students get, which affects mental health.
Is mental health affected by students’ living situations or students’ ability to maintain work-life balance?
Null Hypothesis: Students' mental health is not affected by their living situation or their ability to maintain a work-life balance.
Alternative Hypothesis: Students' mental health is significantly affected by their living situation and their ability to maintain a work-life balance.

This study focuses on students enrolled in STA304H5 during Fall 2024, aiming to provide valuable insights into the effects of academic workload on their overall well-being. By exploring these relationships, the findings may inform strategies to enhance student support services and improve academic experiences.

# Methodology

Between October 8th, 2024, and October 20th, 2024, the questionnaire’s Google Form link was posted on the STA304H5 Piazza course discussion board. We utilized simple random sampling by using the R random generator to randomly sample n = 43 students from the received questionnaire responses.  The use of SRS is an attempt to avoid bias, and each student's response would therefore have an equal chance of being part of the analysis.
On the questionnaire, we asked participants to complete 10 short answer questions inquiring about academic workload, average hours studied weekly, amounts of experienced stress-related symptoms (stress, anxiety, concentration difficulty), hours of sleep per night, current living situation and experienced common issues caused by academic workload (time management, social life, financial).

## 1. Target Population

The target population consists of students enrolled in the STA304H5 course during the Fall 2024 semester.

## 2. Sampling Method

We will use **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** by combining both sections of the STA304H5 course and selecting a random sample of students from the pool. This method assures that each student has an equal chance of being selected, which is important to maintain a representative sample.
We do not anticipate important differences in many variables of interest, such as academic workload and levels of stress, between students in the two sections. Thus SRS is a fair and an efficient method of sampling to generalize findings to the greater STA304H5 student population.

## 3. Variables of interest

The following variables were identified for the research:

### Academic Workload
Academic workload is defined by the number of assignments, projects, exams, and overall demands of the course. This study aims to determine whether higher academic demands are linked to increased mental health problems, such as stress.

### Living Situation
This includes categories such as living alone, living with family, living with roommates, or living on campus. The living situation can significantly affect students' mental health and their ability to cope with academic stress. Factors like social support, privacy, and distractions play a key role.

### Study Hours
Study hours reflect students' study habits and time management. This stratum analyzes whether more study hours correlate with reduced stress and anxiety or lead to exhaustion and increased mental health problems.

### Mental Health Symptoms (Stress, Anxiety, and Concentration Difficulties)
These symptoms are key indicators of students' mental health and may be influenced by academic workload and living conditions. Understanding these relationships helps target interventions and support strategies to improve students' mental well-being.

## 4. Sample Size

In our research, we applied Simple Random Sampling (SRS) on 200 students.
Now, to find out the sample size using the bound of error as 0.29, we used the following formula for the width of confidence interval:
$$
D = \frac{B^2}{4}
$$
Where $B = 0.29$, giving:
$$
D = \frac{(0.29)^2}{4} = 0.021025
$$

Using the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the academic workload variable, we computed the required sample size using the formula:
$$
n = \frac{N \times \sigma^2}{(N-1) \times D + \sigma^2}
$$
Where:

N = 200 (total population size)
B = 0.29 (bound of error)
D = B²/4 = 0.021025
$\sigma$ is approximated as (range of academic workload)/4
range = maximum academic workload - minimum academic workload

To randomize our sampling process, we used R's random sampling function sample() with a fixed seed (set.seed(1)) to randomly select participants from the full dataset based on the calculated sample size n.

### 5. Summary of Questions

The survey will consist of a series of questions designed to capture key variables, including:

* Academic workload (measured in hours per week)
* Quality and duration of sleep (self-reported)
* Stress symptoms (using a standardized scale)
* Living situation (on-campus, off-campus, with family, etc.)
* Work-life balance (self-assessment of management skills)

# Analysis

## ANOVA

RQ1 questions if academic workload contributes to a student’s stress levels. To answer this question, ANOVA (analysis of variance) is used to test the difference in average stress levels between students with different academic workloads. All our assumptions are satisfied as samples between the groups were randomly sampled and responses are independent from each other, data from each group is normally distributed (large sample size, n > 30) and variances are approximately the same (obtained p-value of 0.07758 from Barlett’s test, which is above the α = 0.05 significance level.)

# ANOVA between stress and academic workload

| Variable            | Degrees of Freedom (DF) | Sum of Squares (SS) | Mean Square (MS) | F-value | Pr(>F)         |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| academic workload   | 3                       | 4.145               | 1.3818           | 5.121   | 0.00483***     |
| Residuals           | 35                      | 9.444               | 0.2698           |         |                |

Since the calculated F-value of 5.121 is larger than the critical F-value of 2.874 at a 5% significance level with (3, 35) degrees of freedom, we reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore, there is a statistically significant relationship between student academic workload and levels of stress.

# ANOVA between stress and hours\_sleep

| Variable            | Degrees of Freedom (DF) | Sum of Squares (SS) | Mean Square (MS) | F-value | Pr(>F)         |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| sleep               | 2                       | 0.103               | 0.05128          | 0.163   | 0.85           |
| Residuals           | 36                      | 11.333              | 0.31481          |         |                |

Since the calculated F-value of 0.163 is smaller than the critical F-value of 3.259 at the 5% significance level with (2, 36) degrees of freedom, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
Therefore, there is no statistically significant relationship between hours of sleep and levels of stress among students. This suggests that variations in hours of sleep do not significantly affect variations in stress levels.

# ANOVA between stress and missed social events

| Variable               | Degrees of Freedom (DF) | Sum of Squares (SS) | Mean Square (MS) | F-value | Pr(>F)         |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| missed\_social\_events | 4                       | 1.302               | 0.3254           | 1.092   | 0.376          |
| Residuals              | 34                      | 10.134              | 0.2981           |         |                |

Since the calculated F-value was 1.092 and this is less than the critical value, 2.629 (df=4, df=34). 
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that **stress levels** and **missed social events** do not have a significant relationship.

# Discussion and Results


ANOVA test between stress and academic workload has the calculated F-value of 5.121 is larger than the critical F-value of 2.874 at 5% significance level with (3, 35) degrees of freedom, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the student academic workload and levels of stress correlate at a statistically significant level. Therefore, variation in academic workload is significantly related to variation in stress.

ANOVA test between stress and hours_sleep has the calculated  F -value of 0.163 is smaller than the critical  F -value of 3.259 at the 5% significance level with (2, 36) degrees of freedom; we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no statistically significant correlation between hours of sleep and levels of stress among students. This suggests that variations in hours of sleep do not significantly relate to variations in stress levels.

ANOVA test between stress and missed social events has the calculated F-value was 1.092 and this is less than the critical value, 2.629 (df=4, df=34). Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that stress levels and missed social events do not have a significant relationship.

Overall, the results of the ANOVA tests show that the stress levels of the students sampled are primarily related to academic factors, with lifestyle factors such as sleep and socializing having less of an impact on their mental health than expected. In addition, this voluntary response method was likely to result in selection bias.

# Limitations

This study had two major limitations.

First, our sample size was limited to part of the responses from STA304H5, which might be the reason for failing to reject the null hypothesis related to sleep hours and stress level.

Second, our limitation in the survey was the academic workload measure which focused on time spent in such activities rather than capturing the actual complexity of assignments and different academic tasks. For future research should seek to:

1. Use participation incentives to enhance sample size.
2. More detailed measures of academic workload.

These improvements would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between academic workload and student mental health

## Conclusion

Our analysis of STA304H5 students' academic workload and mental health provided clear answers for all three research questions of this study:

First, on the relationship between academic workload and the problems with mental health:

ANOVA yielded a significant relationship between academic workload and stress level: F = 4.273, p = 0.0136

Chi-square tests showed that academic workload was not significantly associated with either stress or anxiety, but it showed a significant relationship to concentration difficulties:

Regarding academic workload and its relationship with sleep and then finally with mental health:

We did not find a significant association between hours of sleep and levels of stress (F = 2.046, p = 0.148)

This might suggest that the influence of sleeping habits on mental health is not as straightforward or perhaps too subtle for our investigation to have picked up using the current sample size.

On the impact of living situations and work-life balance:

Chi-square tests confirm the significant relations between living situations and all three of the mental health indicators, which are stress, anxiety, and concentration. Similarly, one can establish significant relations between time management skills and financial situation with that of mental health consequences.

For future research, the following points should be considered.

### Methodology Improvements:
- Use stratified sampling to ensure diverse representation across living situations and academic workloads.
- Develop refined measures of academic workload that incorporate assignment complexity and deadlines.

### Research Focus Extensions:
- Investigate specific living situation factors that most significantly affect mental health.
- Explore how various academic tasks uniquely contribute to stress.
- Examine effective time management strategies for reducing academic stress.

### Practical Applications:
- Design interventions targeting links between living situations and mental health.
- Develop standardized workload metrics that account for both time and complexity.
- Implement support programs addressing both academic and environmental impacts on student well-being.
