# Abstract

This study investigates the association between academic workload and student mental health, specifically examining stress levels, sleep quality, and work-life balance among STA304H5 students at our university. The aim is to analyze how these factors correlate with various mental health indicators. Data collection will be based on the structured questionnaire method, while data analyses will be based on chi-square tests of independence, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance to identify which of those relationships and trends are statistically significant.

# Introduction

The academic workload faced by university students has increasingly become one of the critical variables for university students concerning mental health. Given a broader context of increasing academic challenges, many students experience heightened stress levels, which impact various aspects of their well-being, including sleep quality, work-life balance, and several mental health issues.

First, commonly reported mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and stress, have been found to correlate with academic pressures in highly competitive or rigorous programs where students may feel unable to meet academic and personal expectations (Beiter et al., 2015). Second, research indicates that students experiencing high academic workload tend to report poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, which, in turn, can exacerbate mental health problems and academic performance challenges (Hershner & Chervin, 2014; Galambos et al., 2009). Third, students’ living environments and their ability to maintain a balanced lifestyle can also significantly impact mental health, since living in a more supportive and conducive environment positions students to better manage academic responsibilities and personal well-being (Kim & Koh, 2018).

Given the above potential factors, we seek to address the following research questions in this report:
- **Research Question 1:** Is there an association between students’ academic workload and the amount of mental health issues?
  - **Null Hypothesis:** There is no association between academic workload and the amount of mental health issues.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant association between academic workload and the amount of mental health issues.

- **Research Question 2:** How does the academic workload affect the quality/length of sleep and its subsequent impact on students' mental health?
  - **Null Hypothesis:** Academic workload does not affect the quality or length of sleep, nor does it affect students' mental health.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Academic workload significantly affects the quality and/or amount of sleep students get, which affects mental health.

- **Research Question 3:** Is mental health affected by students’ living situations or students’ ability to maintain work-life balance?
  - **Null Hypothesis:** Students' mental health is not affected by their living situation or their ability to maintain a work-life balance.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Students' mental health is significantly affected by their living situation and their ability to maintain a work-life balance.


This study focuses on students enrolled in STA304H5 during Fall 2024, aiming to provide valuable insights into the effects of academic workload on their overall well-being. By exploring these relationships, the findings may inform strategies to enhance student support services and improve academic experiences.

# Methodology

Between October 8th, 2024, and October 20th, 2024, the questionnaire’s Google Form link was posted on the STA304H5 Piazza course discussion board. We utilized simple random sampling by using the R random generator to randomly sample n students from the received questionnaire responses. On the questionnaire, we asked participants to complete 10 short answer questions inquiring about academic workload, average hours studied weekly, amounts of experienced stress-related symptoms (stress, anxiety, concentration difficulty), hours of sleep per night, current living situation and experienced common issues caused by academic workload (time management, social life, financial).


## 1. Target Population

The target population consists of students enrolled in the STA304H5 course during the Fall 2024 semester.

## 2. Sampling Method

We will use **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** by combining both sections of the STA304H5 course and selecting a random sample of students from the pool. This method assures that each student has an equal chance of being selected.

## 3. Variables of Interests

The following variables of interests were identified for the research:

### Academic Workload
Academic workload is defined by the number of assignments, projects, exams, and overall demands of the course. This study aims to determine whether higher academic demands are linked to increased mental health problems, such as stress.

### Living Situation
This includes categories such as living alone, living with family, living with roommates, or living on campus. The living situation can significantly affect students' mental health and their ability to cope with academic stress. Factors like social support, privacy, and distractions play a key role.

### Study Hours
Study hours reflect students' study habits and time management. This stratum analyzes whether more study hours correlate with reduced stress and anxiety or lead to exhaustion and increased mental health problems.

### Mental Health Symptoms (Stress, Anxiety, and Concentration Difficulties)
These symptoms are key indicators of students' mental health and may be influenced by academic workload and living conditions. Understanding these relationships helps target interventions and support strategies to improve students' mental well-being.


## 4. Sample Size

In our research, we applied Simple Random Sampling (SRS) on 200 students. Now, to find out the sample size using the bound of error as 0.25, we used the following formula for the width of confidence interval:

$$
D = \frac{B^2}{4}
$$

Setting $B = 0.29$, we have:

$$
D = \frac{(0.29)^2}{4} = 0.021025
$$

Using the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the academic workload variable, we computed the required sample size using the formula:

$$
n = \frac{N \times \sigma^2}{(N-1) \times D + \sigma^2}
$$

To randomize our sampling process, we used R's random sampling function `sample()` with a fixed seed (`set.seed(1)`) to randomly select participants from the full dataset.


### 5. Summary of Questions


The survey will consist of a series of questions designed to capture key variables, including:

* Academic workload (measured in hours per week)
* Quality and duration of sleep (self-reported)
* Stress symptoms (using a standardized scale)
* Living situation (on-campus, off-campus, with family, etc.)
* Work-life balance (self-assessment of management skills)

# Analysis

## Section 1. ANOVA

# Research Question 1: Academic Workload and Stress Levels

RQ1 questions whether academic workload contributes to a student's stress levels. To answer this question, we attempted using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to test the difference in average stress levels between students with different academic workloads. However, not all our assumptions were satisfied. 

Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality was used to test normality for all our groups; however, for all groups, we received a p-value below 0.05. It is also impossible for our groups to have >30 observations, and thus we failed the normality assumption for ANOVA. The only assumption we could meet was that the samples between the groups were randomly sampled, and responses were independent from each other. This allowed us to test using the non-parametric version of ANOVA, called the Kruskal-Wallis test, where normality and equal variances aren't assumed.

We obtained:  
- Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 6.4099,  
- df = 3,  
- p-value = 0.0932.

Since the calculated p-value of 0.0932 is larger than the 0.05 significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This shows that the difference between the average stress levels across different academic workloads is not significant enough to suggest that different academic workloads have a meaningful impact on student mental health.

However, if we look at the mean stress levels for each rating of academic workloads:

| Workload Rating | Mean Stress Level |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 1                | 1.0000            |
| 2                | 2.2857            |
| 3                | 2.6154            |
| 4                | 2.7000            |

Students who report heavier academic workloads have higher stress levels.

# Research Question 2: Sleep Quality and Stress Levels

Regarding sleep quality against average stress levels, we first ran a Shapiro-Wilk test to see if the data followed a normal distribution. When we ran the Shapiro-Wilk test, we got a p-value of 0.02971, which is less than 0.05, showing that hours of sleep don't follow a normal distribution. This violates the assumptions of ANOVA analysis of hours of sleep, so we decided to use the Kruskal-Wallis test. 

We obtained:  
- p-value = 0.1115,  

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we can't conclude that there is a significant difference between hours of sleep and stress levels. Therefore, we can't reject the null hypothesis that sleep duration doesn't affect stress levels.

We also examined the mean stress level across different sleep categories:

| Sleep Category        | Mean Stress Level |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Less than 6 hours      | 2.00              |
| 6-8 hours              | 2.67              |
| More than 8 hours      | 2.22              |

While the Kruskal-Wallis test shows no significant difference between stress and sleep duration, averaging the stress levels across hours of sleep shows that the group with 6-8 hours of sleep has a higher stress level than the other two groups. However, the differences are not dramatically different, so we can't draw conclusions based on simple averages. It's possible that we didn't find statistical significance because of the small sample size.

---

# Research Question 3: Social Events and Stress Levels

For RQ3, we examined the relationship between average stress levels and the frequency of missed social events of the sampled students. This relationship would imply a possible effect on students' mental health due to varying work-life balances. 

Similar to the other two tests, we ran the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, obtaining a p-value of 0.01873, again failing the normality assumption. Therefore, we proceeded with the Kruskal-Wallis test.

We obtained:  
- Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 2.6958,  
- df = 4,  
- p-value = 0.0932.

Since the calculated p-value of 0.0932 is larger than the 0.05 significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This shows that the difference between the average stress levels across different frequencies of missing social events is not significant enough to suggest that work-life balance has a meaningful impact on student mental health.

However, if we look at the mean stress levels for each rating of work-life balance:

| Social Events Missed | Mean Stress Level |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1                     | 2.00              |
| 2                     | 2.60              |
| 3                     | 2.70              |
| 4                     | 2.44              |
| 5                     | 2.50              |

Students who miss social events more frequently tend to report higher stress levels.

# Section 3. Simple and Multiple Linear Regressions
This part of the analysis is concerned with the application of linear regression to answer the three research questions as outlined above in the introduction.

## Research Question 1

### a. Relevant graphs & tables
Research Question 1 is concerned with determining whether there is a relationship between students’ academic workload and the prevalence of mental health issues in students. To answer this question, we start by plotting a boxplot of academic workload by stress level. This plot suggests that higher stress levels are associated with a higher academic workload. On average, students who "Always" or "Sometimes" feel stressed tend to have a higher workload than those who "Never" feel stressed. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

my_data <- read.csv("STA304 Group Project Dataset.csv", header=TRUE, sep=',')

data_cleaned <- my_data[,!(names(my_data)=="X")]
# Remove fake responses on row 3 and 12
data_cleaned <- data_cleaned[-c(3, 12),]
data_cleaned

N = 200
B = .29
D = (B^2)/4
sigma = sd(data_cleaned$academic_workload)
n = ceiling((N * sigma^2) / ((N-1) * D + sigma^2))
n

# Select a random sample of n rows
set.seed(1)
random_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data_cleaned), n)
sample_data <- data_cleaned[random_indices, ]

sample_data$stress <- factor(sample_data$stress, levels = c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always"))
boxplot_plot <- ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = factor(stress), y = academic_workload)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#56B4E9", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Academic Workload by Stress Level",
       x = "Stress Level",
       y = "Academic Workload") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot_plot)

# # Create a boxplot of hours_sleep by stress_binary
# boxplot_plot <- ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = factor(stress_binary), y = hours_sleep)) +
#   geom_boxplot(fill = "#56B4E9", color = "black") +  # Customize the colors if desired
#   labs(title = "Boxplot of Hours of Sleep by Stress Level",
#        x = "Stress (0 = No Stress, 1 = Stress)",
#        y = "Hours of Sleep") +
#   theme_minimal()

# # Display the plot
# print(boxplot_plot)
```

### c. Necessary Assumptions
To confirm this association, we implement a simple linear regression model, where the dependent variable is stress_numeric (the stress variable, converted to numeric values), and the independent variable is academic_workload. To implement this model, we check the following assumptions using the following plot of the residuals:

![Residuals Plot](residuals_rq1.png){width=80%}

 1. Independence of errors: Since the plot has no noticable pattern, the independence assumption is satisfied.
 2. Normality of errors: Since our sample size is sufficiently large, by the Central Limit Theorem the sample mean (and by extension, the sampling distribution of residuals) approximately follows a Normal distribution. 
 3. Homogeneity of variances amongst errors: Since the residuals plot has a "horizontal band appearance", this suggests that the error have mean zero and a constant variance.

 Since all the assumptions are met, we run the regression and obtain the output below using the code in Appendix B:

### d. Computation and statistical test output
Call:
lm(formula = stress_numeric ~ academic_workload, data = sample_data)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-1.5301 -0.3668  0.1434  0.4699  0.7965

Coefficients:
                  Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)   
(Intercept)        1.22389    0.40942   2.989  0.00495 **
academic_workload  0.32655    0.09945   3.284  0.00224 **
---
Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

Residual standard error: 0.5353 on 37 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.2256,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2047
F-statistic: 10.78 on 1 and 37 DF,  p-value: 0.002245

The equation of the regression line is given by: $stress = 1.22389 + 0.32655*workload$

### e. Interpretation
The small $p-value = 0.00224$ indicates that academic workload is a significant predictor of stress. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a significant relationship between students academic workload and their stress levels.


## Research Question 2

### a. Relevant graphs & tables
Research Question 2 investigates whether there is a relationship between students’ academic workload, the amount of sleep they get, and impact on mental health. Since the ANOVA below showed no significant relationship between stress and hours of sleep, we investigate the effect of another factor, the number of missed social events.To begin, we plot a boxplot of hours of sleep by the number of missed social events. This plot suggests students who miss more social events tend to have fewer hours of sleep on average.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

my_data <- read.csv("STA304 Group Project Dataset.csv", header=TRUE, sep=',')

data_cleaned <- my_data[,!(names(my_data)=="X")]
# Remove fake responses on row 3 and 12
data_cleaned <- data_cleaned[-c(3, 12),]
data_cleaned

N = 200
B = .29
D = (B^2)/4
sigma = sd(data_cleaned$academic_workload)
n = ceiling((N * sigma^2) / ((N-1) * D + sigma^2))
n

# Select a random sample of n rows
set.seed(1)
random_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data_cleaned), n)
sample_data <- data_cleaned[random_indices, ]

boxplot_plot <- ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = factor(missed_social_events), y = hours_sleep)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#56B4E9", color = "black") +  # Customize the colors if desired
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Hours of Sleep by Missed Social Events",
       x = "Missed Social Events",
       y = "Hours of Sleep") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(boxplot_plot)
```


### c. Necessary Assumptions
To assess this relationship, we use a multiple linear regression model with hours of sleep as the dependent variable, and academic workload and missed social events as the independent variables. Before interpreting this model, we check the following assumptions:

![Residuals Plot](residuals_rq2.png){width=80%}
![QQ Plot](qq_rq2.png){width=80%}

1. Independence of errors: The residual plot shown above indicates no clear patterns, which suggests independence.
2. Normality of errors: Since the sample size is large, the Central Limit Theorem implies that the residuals should approximate a normal distribution. Also, a QQ-plot confirms Normality.
3. Homogeneity of variances: The residuals plot exhibits a roughly horizontal band, indicating constant variance across predicted values.
4. No multi-collinearity: We calculated the VIF of each independent variable, and found that $VIF(academic\_workload) = 1.076844$, and $VIF(missed\_social\_events) = 1.076844$. Since they are both less than 5,this indicates there is little correlation between them.

With all assumptions adequately met, we proceed with the regression analysis.

### d. Computation and statistical test output
```{r}
lm(formula = hours_sleep ~ academic_workload + missed_social_events, 
    data = sample_data)
```
| Residuals          | Min | 1Q| Median| 3Q | Max |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| -1.37588| -0.54906|-0.09342| 0.60662| 0.93   |  2.53031
---
| Predictor               | Estimate | Std. Error | t value | Pr(>|t|)  |
|-------------------------|----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| (Intercept)             | 8.5521   | 0.6661     | 12.838  | 5.3e-15   |
| academic_workload       | -0.1412  | 0.1666     | -0.848  | 0.40208   |
| missed_social_events    | -0.3763  | 0.1194     | -3.151  | 0.00327   |


---
| Metric                           | Value              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Residual standard error          | 0.864 on 36 DF     |
| Multiple R-squared               | 0.2653             |
| Adjusted R-squared               | 0.2245             |
| F-statistic                      | 6.5 on 2 and 36 DF |
| p-value                          | 0.003889           |



The regression equation is given by:

$hours\_of\_sleep = 8.5521 − 0.1412 * academic\_workload − 0.3763 * missed\_social\_events$

### e. Interpretation

The output of the regression analysis shows that the missed social events has a statistically significant negative association with hours of sleep (p = 0.00327). However, academic workload does not have a significant relationship with hours of sleep (p = 0.40208).

## Research Question 3

### a. Relevant graphs & tables
Research Question 3 examines whether mental health, represented by stress levels, is affected by students’ living situations and their ability to maintain a work-life balance. To explore this relationship, we first plot a boxplot of stress level by missed social events, with students grouped by stress categories ("Always," "Never," and "Sometimes"). This plot suggests that students who miss social events "Always" or "Sometimes" have higher stress levels, while those who "Never" miss social events report lower stress levels.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

my_data <- read.csv("STA304 Group Project Dataset.csv", header=TRUE, sep=',')

data_cleaned <- my_data[,!(names(my_data)=="X")]
# Remove fake responses on row 3 and 12
data_cleaned <- data_cleaned[-c(3, 12),]
data_cleaned

N = 200
B = .29
D = (B^2)/4
sigma = sd(data_cleaned$academic_workload)
n = ceiling((N * sigma^2) / ((N-1) * D + sigma^2))
n

# Select a random sample of n rows
set.seed(1)
random_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data_cleaned), n)
sample_data <- data_cleaned[random_indices, ]
boxplot_plot <- ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = factor(stress), y = missed_social_events)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#56B4E9", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Missed Social Events by Stress Level",
       x = "Missed Social Events",
       y = "Stress Level") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot_plot)
```



### c. Necessary Assumptions
To investigate the impact of missed social events and living situations on stress, we use a multiple linear regression model. The response variable is stress (in numeric form), and the predictors are missed social events and living situation. We verify the following assumptions:

![Residuals Plot](residuals_rq3.png){width=80%}
![QQ Plot](qq_rq2.png){width=80%}

1. Independence of errors: The residual plot indicates no clear patterns, suggesting that the errors are  independent.
2. Normality of errors: Since the sample size is large, the Central Limit Theorem implies that the residuals should approximate a normal distribution. Also, a QQ-plot confirms Normality.
3. Homogeneity of variances: The residuals plot exhibits a roughly horizontal band, indicating constant variance across predicted values.
4. No multi-collinearity: Since both VIF values are close to 1, there’s no indication of multicollinearity in this model.

With all assumptions adequately met, we proceed with the regression analysis.

### d. Computation and statistical test output
Call:
lm(formula = stress_numeric ~ missed_social_events + living_situation, 
    data = sample_data)

Residuals:

| Predictor                             | Estimate | Std. Error | t value | Pr(>|t|) |

The equation of the regression line is given by:

$stress = 1.93006 + 0.15560 * missed\_social\_events + 0.81061*living\_situation\_living\_on\_campus + 0.21206*living\_with\_family + 0.30493*living\_with\_roommates$

# Discussion and Results

Kruskal-Wallis test between stress and academic workload has the calculated P-value of 0.09332, which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that stress levels and academic workload do not have a significant relationship.

Kruskal-Wallis test between stress and hours of sleep has the calculated P-value of 0.02971, which is larger than 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to determine a connection between hours of sleep and levels of stress among students. This suggests that variations in hours of sleep do not significantly relate to variations in stress levels.

Kruskal-Wallis test between stress and missed social events has the calculated P-value of 0.61, which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that stress levels and missed social events do not have a significant relationship.
For the chi square tests of independence bewteen academic workload and stress, anxiety, the respective p values are 0.0002288 and 0.0284 which are both less than the alpha a=0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis. For the chi square tests of indpendence between academic workload and concentration, the p value is 0.3696, which is greater than the alpha a=0.05, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that a student's academic workload has an on their stress or anxiety but not their concentration . 

Chi square tests between students' living situation and their stress, anxiety and concentration yield p values of 0.5446, 0.359, and 0.8241 respectively. All of these p values are greater than the alpha a=0.05, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis for all three of these chi square tests. This suggests that the living situation of a student doesn't have an association with their stress, anxiety and concentration. 

Chi square tests between students' time management skills and their stress, anxiety and concentration yield p values of 0.2078, 0.5851, and 0.3151 respectively. All of these p values are greater than the alpha a=0.05, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis for all three of these chi square tests. This suggests that a student's ability to manage their time doesn't have an association with their stress, anxiety and concentration. 

Chi square tests between students' financials and their stress, anxiety and concentration yield p values of 0.7223, 0.7236, and 0.6308 respectively. All of these p values are greater than the alpha a=0.05, therefore we fai to reject the null hypothesis for all three of these chi square tests. This suggests that a student's financial situation doesn't have an association with their stress, anxiety and concentration. 

The results of the multiple and linear regression tests indicate that missed social events are a marginally significant predictor of stress levels (p = 0.0518). Living situation, specifically living on campus, is also a marginally significant predictor (p = 0.0502). However, living with family (p = 0.4590) and living with roommates (p = 0.2383) do not significantly predict stress. 

Overall, the results of this study show that stress among college students is primarily related to academic factors, with lifestyle factors such as sleep and socializing having less of an impact than expected.

# 6. Limitations

Although this study has provided several valuable insights into the relationship between students' workload, stress, sleep, and work-life balance, there are a few limitations that may have affected the accuracy of the findings. Some of these limitations include possible issues with ensuring sample randomization, survey question design, and sample size. The first limitation is the potential issue with ensuring randomization in the sample selection. Although we aimed to select a random sample of students from the survey responses, the process may have been influenced by biases in how respondents answered the survey. For example, certain groups of students may have been more likely to complete the survey, potentially leading to an unrepresentative sample. Additionally, some of the survey questions could have been clearer or more specific, which might have helped reduce the possibility of misinterpretation. Lastly, expanding the sample size would improve the accuracy and applicability of the findings. In the future, the study could be improved by ensuring a completely randomised design and revisiting our survey questions to capture more accurate responses.

# 7. Conclusion 


The linear regression analysis conducted for the three research questions of this study provides valuable insights into the factors affecting student stress and mental health. For Research Question 1, we found a significant positive relationship between academic workload and stress levels, suggesting that students with heavier workloads tend to experience higher levels of stress. In Research Question 2, while academic workload did not significantly impact the amount of sleep, missed social events were found to significantly reduce hours of sleep, which may contribute to poor mental health. For Research Question 3, missed social events and living situation were marginally significant predictors of stress, indicating that students who miss social events or live on campus tend to report higher stress levels. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors in understanding a student's overall well-being. However, the limitations of this analysis, including potential issues with sample randomization and measurement quality, should be addressed in future research to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the results. Future studies should also explore other possible variables, such as social support and coping mechanisms, which may further explain the mental health challenges faced by students.
